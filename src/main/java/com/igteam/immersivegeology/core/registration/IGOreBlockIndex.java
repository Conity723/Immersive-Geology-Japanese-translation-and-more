/**
 * Cache Resolver for ore blocks allows lookups for every (material, stone, richness) combination.
 * <p>
 * The uncached lookup would cost about six string allocations per call... on a loop over {@link
 * com.igteam.immersivegeology.core.material.helper.flags.ModFlags} to work out the registry prefix, three
 * lowercase conversions and the surrounding concatenations, before it hits the registry map lookup. World
 * generation calls it once per candidate block... That's a shitload of calls.
 * <p>
 * A material's whole table is filled on first use and never changes afterwards. Blocks are registry singletons and
 * the combinations that exist are decided during registration. Combinations that were never registered stay null,
 * so we can just cache everything instead, it's not a huge performance boost... about like ~5% better in the best case,
 * around ~2% in the worst.
 *
 * Performance was most affected by changes are in how the noise generates.
